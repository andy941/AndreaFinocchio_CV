\section{About me}
I have been a scientist my all life. After a bachelor in plant biotechnology
and a master in bioinformatics at the University of Milan, I moved to Dublin
and applied my skills to generate and analyse complex transcriptomics and
proteomics datasets discovering a passion for programming, algorithms and
bioinformatics. My interests lay where biology meets programming. Over the
years I have accumulate experience in \texttt{C++}, \texttt{Rust}, \texttt{R},
\texttt{python}, \texttt{bash}, together with the knowhow to produce genomics,
transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. I am currently working in Illumina,
company leader in the DNA sequencing space, as a software developer on DRAGEN,
Illumina's best-in-class secondary analysis platform for which I am dealing
with probability modeling, software engineering and algorithm development on a
daily basis. In my spare time I like to learn new skills and continue to
improve in areas that fascinate me like machine learning, algorithms applied
to bioinformatics and high-performance computing. I self-taught myself a lot
of skills and continue to do so (check out \textcolor{blue}{{\httplink[my
