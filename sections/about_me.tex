\section{About me}
I have been a scientist my all life. After a bachelor in plant biotechnology
and a master in bioinformatics at the University of Milan, I moved to Dublin
and applied my skills to generate and analyse complex transcriptomics and
proteomics datasets discovering a passion for programming, algorithms and
bioinformatics. My interests lay where biology meets programming. Over the
years I have accumulate strong programming skills in C++, R, Python, Bash,
together with the knowhow to produce genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics
datasets. This has culminated in my current job Illumina, where I work as a
software developer for DRAGEN, Illumina's best-in-class secondary analysis
platform. Learning new things and building useful tools is what I strive for
in life. In my spare time I like to learn new skills and continue to improve
in areas that fascinate me like machine learning, algorithms applied to
bioinformatics and high-performance computing. I self-taught myself a lot of
skills and continue to do so (check out \textcolor{blue}{{\httplink[my GitHub
