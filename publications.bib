	abstract = {In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the zinc-finger
	            transcription factor KNUCKLES (KNU) plays an important role in the
	            termination of floral meristem activity, a process that is crucial
	            for preventing the overgrowth of flowers. The KNU gene is activated
	            in floral meristems by the floral organ identity factor AGAMOUS
	            (AG), and it has been shown that both AG and KNU act in floral
	            meristem control by directly repressing the stem cell regulator
	            WUSCHEL (WUS), which leads to a loss of stem cell activity. When we
	            re-examined the expression pattern of KNU in floral meristems, we
	            found that KNU is expressed throughout the center of floral
	            meristems, which includes, but is considerably broader than the WUS
	            expression domain. We therefore hypothesized that KNU may have
	            additional functions in the control of floral meristem activity. To
	            test this, we employed a gene perturbation approach and knocked
	            down KNU activity at different times and in different domains of
	            the floral meristem. In these experiments we found that early
	            expression in the stem cell domain, which is characterized by the
	            expression of the key meristem regulatory gene CLAVATA3 (CLV3), is
	            crucial for the establishment of KNU expression. The results of
	            additional genetic and molecular analyses suggest that KNU
	            represses floral meristem activity to a large extent by acting on
	            CLV3. Thus, KNU might need to suppress the expression of several
	            meristem regulators to terminate floral meristem activity
	            efficiently.},

abstract = {MADS-domain transcription factors are involved in the control of a multitude of processes in eukaryotes, and in plants, they play particularly important roles during reproductive development. Among the members of this large family of regulatory proteins are the floral organ identity factors, which specify the identities of the different types of floral organs in a combinatorial manner. Much has been learned over the past three decades about the function of these master regulators. For example, it has been shown that they have similar DNA-binding activities and that their genome-wide binding patterns exhibit large overlaps. At the same time, it appears that only a minority of binding events lead to changes in gene expression and that the different floral organ identity factors have distinct sets of target genes. Thus, binding of these transcription factors to the promoters of target genes alone may not be sufficient for their regulation. How these master regulators achieve specificity in a developmental context is currently not well understood. Here, we review what is known about their activities and highlight open questions that need to be addressed to gain more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions. We discuss evidence for the involvement of cofactors as well as the results from studies on transcription factors in animals that may be instructive for a better understanding of how the floral organ identity factors achieve regulatory specificity.},
