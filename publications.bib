	abstract = {In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the zinc-finger
	            transcription factor KNUCKLES (KNU) plays an important role in the
	            termination of floral meristem activity, a process that is crucial
	            for preventing the overgrowth of flowers. The KNU gene is activated
	            in floral meristems by the floral organ identity factor AGAMOUS
	            (AG), and it has been shown that both AG and KNU act in floral
	            meristem control by directly repressing the stem cell regulator
	            WUSCHEL (WUS), which leads to a loss of stem cell activity. When we
	            re-examined the expression pattern of KNU in floral meristems, we
	            found that KNU is expressed throughout the center of floral
	            meristems, which includes, but is considerably broader than the WUS
	            expression domain. We therefore hypothesized that KNU may have
	            additional functions in the control of floral meristem activity. To
	            test this, we employed a gene perturbation approach and knocked
	            down KNU activity at different times and in different domains of
	            the floral meristem. In these experiments we found that early
	            expression in the stem cell domain, which is characterized by the
	            expression of the key meristem regulatory gene CLAVATA3 (CLV3), is
	            crucial for the establishment of KNU expression. The results of
	            additional genetic and molecular analyses suggest that KNU
	            represses floral meristem activity to a large extent by acting on
	            CLV3. Thus, KNU might need to suppress the expression of several
	            meristem regulators to terminate floral meristem activity
	            efficiently.},

	abstract = {Proximity-labelling has emerged as a powerful tool for the
	            detection of weak and transient interactions between proteins as
	            well as the characterization of subcellular proteomes. One
	            proximity labelling approach makes use of a promiscuous bacterial
	            biotin ligase, termed BioID. Expression of BioID (or of its
	            derivates TurboID and MiniTurbo) fused to a bait protein results in

	            can then be isolated by affinity purification using
	            streptavidin-coated beads and identified by mass spectrometry. To
	            facilitate the use of proximity-labelling in plants, we have
	            generated a collection of constructs that can be used for the rapid
	            cloning of TurboID and MiniTurbo fusion proteins using the Golden
	            Gate cloning method. To allow for the use of the constructs in a

	            the biotin ligases fused to different linkers as well as different
	            commonly used subcellular localization sequences. We demonstrate
	            the functionality of these vectors through biotinylation assays in

abstract = {MADS-domain transcription factors are involved in the control of a multitude of processes in eukaryotes, and in plants, they play particularly important roles during reproductive development. Among the members of this large family of regulatory proteins are the floral organ identity factors, which specify the identities of the different types of floral organs in a combinatorial manner. Much has been learned over the past three decades about the function of these master regulators. For example, it has been shown that they have similar DNA-binding activities and that their genome-wide binding patterns exhibit large overlaps. At the same time, it appears that only a minority of binding events lead to changes in gene expression and that the different floral organ identity factors have distinct sets of target genes. Thus, binding of these transcription factors to the promoters of target genes alone may not be sufficient for their regulation. How these master regulators achieve specificity in a developmental context is currently not well understood. Here, we review what is known about their activities and highlight open questions that need to be addressed to gain more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions. We discuss evidence for the involvement of cofactors as well as the results from studies on transcription factors in animals that may be instructive for a better understanding of how the floral organ identity factors achieve regulatory specificity.},

	abstract = {Research and medical genomics require comprehensive, scalable methods for the discovery of novel disease targets, evolutionary drivers and genetic markers with clinical significance. This necessitates a framework to identify all types of variants independent of their size or location. Here we present DRAGEN, which uses multigenome mapping with pangenome references, hardware acceleration and machine learning-based variant detection to provide insights into individual genomes, with {\textasciitilde}30â€‰min of computation time from raw reads to variant detection. DRAGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy across all variant types (single-nucleotide variations, insertions or deletions, short tandem repeats, structural variations and copy number variations) and incorporates specialized methods for analysis of medically relevant genes. We demonstrate the performance of DRAGEN across 3,202 whole-genome sequencing datasets by generating fully genotyped multisample variant call format files and demonstrate its scalability, accuracy and innovation to further advance the integration of comprehensive genomics. Overall, DRAGEN marks a major milestone in sequencing data analysis and will provide insights across various diseases, including Mendelian and rare diseases, with a highly comprehensive and scalable platform.},
