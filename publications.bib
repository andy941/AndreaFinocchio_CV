	abstract = {In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the zinc-finger
	            transcription factor KNUCKLES (KNU) plays an important role in the
	            termination of floral meristem activity, a process that is crucial
	            for preventing the overgrowth of flowers. The KNU gene is activated
	            in floral meristems by the floral organ identity factor AGAMOUS
	            (AG), and it has been shown that both AG and KNU act in floral
	            meristem control by directly repressing the stem cell regulator
	            WUSCHEL (WUS), which leads to a loss of stem cell activity. When we
	            re-examined the expression pattern of KNU in floral meristems, we
	            found that KNU is expressed throughout the center of floral
	            meristems, which includes, but is considerably broader than the WUS
	            expression domain. We therefore hypothesized that KNU may have
	            additional functions in the control of floral meristem activity. To
	            test this, we employed a gene perturbation approach and knocked
	            down KNU activity at different times and in different domains of
	            the floral meristem. In these experiments we found that early
	            expression in the stem cell domain, which is characterized by the
	            expression of the key meristem regulatory gene CLAVATA3 (CLV3), is
	            crucial for the establishment of KNU expression. The results of
	            additional genetic and molecular analyses suggest that KNU
	            represses floral meristem activity to a large extent by acting on
	            CLV3. Thus, KNU might need to suppress the expression of several
	            meristem regulators to terminate floral meristem activity
	            efficiently.},

	abstract = {Proximity-labelling has emerged as a powerful tool for the
	            detection of weak and transient interactions between proteins as
	            well as the characterization of subcellular proteomes. One
	            proximity labelling approach makes use of a promiscuous bacterial
	            biotin ligase, termed BioID. Expression of BioID (or of its
	            derivates TurboID and MiniTurbo) fused to a bait protein results in
	            the biotinylation of proximal proteins. These biotinylated proteins
	            can then be isolated by affinity purification using
	            streptavidin-coated beads and identified by mass spectrometry. To
	            facilitate the use of proximity-labelling in plants, we have
	            generated a collection of constructs that can be used for the rapid
	            cloning of TurboID and MiniTurbo fusion proteins using the Golden
	            Gate cloning method. To allow for the use of the constructs in a
	            range of experiments we have designed assembly modules that encode
	            the biotin ligases fused to different linkers as well as different
	            commonly used subcellular localization sequences. We demonstrate
	            the functionality of these vectors through biotinylation assays in
	            tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants.},
